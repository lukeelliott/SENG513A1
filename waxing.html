			<h2>Waxing your Snowboard</h2>
			<p>
				A good coat of wax will make your board fly down the runs and float over the powder. However, waxing is also an 
				extremely important part of maintaining your snowboard, as it protects your base and fills in minor imperfections before they can get worse.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<h3>Materials required:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A block of wax rated for a suitable temperature</li>
					<li>A tuning iron, for melting the wax</li>
					<li>A wax scraper, for removing excess wax</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Before beginning, consult this table to find out what temperature to use to melt the wax based on its temperature rating
				<table>

				<h3>Step by Step:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Heat up the tuning iron to the suggested temperature and hold the block of wax to it over the board. Try and point a corner of the iron straight down so 
					the wax drips right off of it. A good zigzag pattern is used to make sure it's applied all over.</li>
					<li>Once a suitable amount has been applied, run the iron over the board, spreading out the wax evenly, making sure there are no lumps left over.</li>
					<li>Allow the board to cool for half an hour, some snowboards have porous bases and should be left longer, for the wax to really be absorbed into the base.</li>
					<li>Using the wax scraper, scrape off the wax in long strokes from tip to tail. The goal isn't to take too much off, (though a lot will come off) but to make 
					the bottom of the board nice and smooth.</li>
					<li>And you're done!</li>
