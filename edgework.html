			<h2>Maintaining Your Edges</h2>
			<p>
				One of the most important things to consider when maintaining a snowboard
				is the condition of your egdes. Riders tend to sharpen their edges before waxing. They need to be sharpened in a way to 
				supplement your riding style.

			<h3>If you prefer carving:</h3>	
			<p>
				You will want to sharpen all the way along your effective edges. This should be done 
				by using an actual edge sharpener, to make sure you maintain the same angle all the way 
				along the edge.
			</p>
			<h3>If you prefer freestyle riding:</h3>
			<p>
				You don't want your edges to be very sharp. Sharp edges lead to faceplants when trying 
				to spin or pivot on the board. You want your edges dull to ensure you don't catch them.
			</p>
			<h3>Next: Waxing</h3>
