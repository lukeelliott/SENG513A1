			<h2>Setting your Bindings</h2>
			<p>
				There are lots of different types of bindings, that take a variety of boots. A general rule of thumb is stiffer bindings for more experienced riders, or more flexible 
				bindings for freestyle or park riding.
			</p>	
			<p>
				<h3>Setting your stance</h3>
				Setting your stance is simply a matter of moving some screws in the baseplate around under the boots. Most people will have their front foot out between 10 and 15 degrees 
				and there back foot at 0 degrees. Many riders go with a "duck stance" and have their bindings set in a way that's symmetrical to allow for easy switch riding, for example 12 degrees 
				out on both feet.
				
				It's also a good idea to make sure your bindings are screwed in tight every few runs, as bumps can knock them loose and many riders have had bindings come off at bad times.
